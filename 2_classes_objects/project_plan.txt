## oo_rps.rb project plan

In RPS, a single `player` "player" will play against another single `player`  "computer". Each `player` will make a `move` to choose between the following available choices [rock, paper, scissors], and "player" and "computer's" cooresponding choices will be `compared` to determine the `winner`, based on the following `rule`: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, and if the choices are the same, it's a tie. The result will be displayed.
